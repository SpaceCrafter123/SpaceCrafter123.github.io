“As soon as I alighted from the car, gathering the items for our Pookar stall, the bustling environment at RKTNC made my mood extremely elated. I had quickly set up the Pookar stall, along with the gifts made for the children playing games in our area for even more entertainment, and although the celebration hadn’t started yet, the energy was so positive, accompanied by hardworking devotees everywhere. I had started to explore since the people for the celebration had not appeared yet. The stall a few feet from the Pookar stall had beautiful wooden imprinted shlokas and quotes from Vedas, Puranas, and even the Mahabharata and Ramayana. A stall near the Yamuna pond had auspicious books of Swami Mukundananda and the Mahabharata, along with fliers to inform the devotees entering the celebration. I also took a look at the setup for the fancy dress, dance, and singing celebration for the children. A day before, I had just envisioned the dahi handi and the excitement; now I was experiencing the meticulous planning and service of all the devotees accomplished. After exploring, other members of Pookar had begun to come, and a few devotees had also entered the celebration. After exploring, I acknowledged that this celebration preparation had come to the point of siddha. Now it is time to introduce Krishna devotees to my experience volunteering for the Pookar stall.

 I distributed pamphlets to the attendees and played games. Two middle-aged adults had even played one of the games and received the gifts that Neetaji’s granddaughter and I made. Their joy in the celebration made me even more motivated and lifted up my mood in the celebration even more. The food that the people had prepared was favored by many of the devotees, and I believe it was because it had the supreme blessing of Shri Krishna. The other fellow Pookar volunteers had also meticulously prepared terrariums with figurines, rocks, and plants included, which the devotees thought were extremely detailed and astonishing. Their hard work had really paid off.

At around noon, the celebration was at its peak, with positivity clearly visible in conversations among people and with the children performing their talent in the bhakti of Shri Krishna’s Janmahotsav. The dahi handi was also about to occur, and I was especially excited about this as RKTNC highlighted the lovely leela of Shri Krishna, feeding his Sakhas and himself, along with protecting the village from Kansa’s tyrannical behavior. The children, attempting to mimic Krishna and his Sakhas, eventually broke the handi, and lots of sweet chocolates were scattered about. The devotees had also begun to enter the area where a divine portrayal of the Makhan Chor was situated. Little Shri Krishna appeared to be incredibly adorable, with his beautiful moor pankh, stealing and eating Makhan that Maiya Yashoda had prepared. Children had begun to play games such as the beanbag toss and trivia to entertain themselves after they had participated in their performances and experienced the Dahi handi. I began to distribute  Pookar pamphlets, and they were extremely astonished, letting their parents know about Pookar and diffusing enthusiasm among society.

Near the end of my volunteer experience, at around 4:00 PM, fewer performances occurred, and all the people around began to prepare for the Krishna Janmahotsav at 12:00 am, the exciting part. Everywhere I saw, people were helping eachother to create the perfect place for the devotion and celebration of the birth of Shri Krishna near the temple entrance. It was so exhilarating, with the trees and vegetation all around as well, it seemed as if the trees were the gokul wale, celebrating the birth of Shri Krishna. I remember helping the devotees with chairs, along with the pooja samagri, in preparation for the jubilation. At 12 am, the chants of ‘Hare Krishna Hare Rama’ had begun, filling RKTNC with a divine environment as well as the prasad that the devotees had prepared. Shri Krishna’s new clothes were absolutely stunning, and the pooja was filled with so much positive energy, with devotees all around. It is the best experience I had all year. After the celebration, I left for home in the same car I had come in and experienced this wonderful day. I hope you all enjoyed my description of the celebration and plan on coming! Until then, Radhe Radhe and Hare Krishna.”
